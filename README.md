# Chainline <br>
Chainline is a python os, or right now a cml and a high level language
<br>
It can manouver files easily and slippery like a chain shifts with 1,000,000 bottles of chain lube on it <br>
## Commandline
Colors :O <br>
Has a few commands that were easy to use once <br>
Basicly type `help` to know them <br>
## Programming language
Any real operating system has its own programming language (not true)<br>
None the less this one has, its called clss (chainlink scripting syntax)<br>
To get started just make a file and call it whatever you want, it can be a .txt, .py, or anything<br>
In order for it to be organised i recommend using .clss as it is easy to find your chainlink files then<br>
Then to run the script just link together the script path and interpreter script (found in the repo)<br>
Make sure to read the [documentation](https://github.com/simon-esp/ChainLine/blob/main/CLSS/DOCS.md) and try it out :)<br>
## Installing<br>
(not that you should)<br>
Its a python file (shocking) so i recommend either running in vscode or just normal terminal<br>
You can change the script anytime so its open-source i guess?<br>
### Steps:
1. Download .zip file
2. Unzip and drag the folder where you want it
3. Make sure the script is updated, copy the script from [main.py](https://github.com/simon-esp/ChainLine/blob/main/main.py)
4. Go to your terminal and type `cd chainline`
5. Run it by typing `python3 chainline.py`
6. Follow the instructions, if you are unsure about anything like your clear command just google<br>
   On windows its `cls` and on linux its `clear`
