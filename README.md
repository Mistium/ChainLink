# Chainlink <br>
Chainlink is supposed to be an operating system (its quite far off)<br>
It has a custom high level language designed to interact with the keyring<br>
(Keyring is the front gear on a mountain bike, in this context it is the terminal / shell)<br>

## Commandline
It is called keyring, it was the first step i took when developing this<br>
It has a few commands that were easy to use once <br>
Basicly type `help` to know them <br>
## Programming language
Any real operating system has its own programming language (not true)<br>
None the less this one has, its called clss (chainlink scripting syntax)<br>
To get started just make a file and call it whatever you want, it can be a .txt, .py, or anything<br>
In order for it to be organised i recommend using .clss as it is easy to find your chainlink files then<br>
Then to run the script just link together the script path and interpreter script (found in the repo)<br>
Make sure to read the [documentation](https://github.com/simon-esp/ChainLine/blob/main/CLSS/DOCS.md) and try it out :)<br>
## Installing<br>
(not that you should)<br>
Its a python file (shocking) so i recommend either running in vscode or just normal terminal<br>
It might not always work as it will probably be mid development<br>
### Steps:
1. Download python debugger like the one microsoft has<br>
2. Make a file called `data.txt` and put in your preffered username and host (not used really, just cosmetic for now)<br>
3. Choose a password and hash it, i recommend [this website](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html), input as utf-8 and output as hex<br>
4. Put it in a file that you will call `password.txt`, make sure you are putting them inside the folder you have your python script<br>
5. Run the python file with the debugger, doesnt matter which one you use<br>
6. Follow the instructions, if you are unsure about anything like your clear command just google<br>
   On windows its `cls` and on linux its `clear`<br>
