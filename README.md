# Chainline <br>
Chainline is a python os, or right now a cml. <br>
It can manouver files easily and slippery like a chain shifts with 1,000,000 bottles of chain lube on it <br>
## Commandline
Colors :O <br>
Has a few commands that were easy to use once <br>
Basicly type `help` to know them <br>
## Installing<br>
(not that you should)<br>
Its a python file (shocking) so i recommend either running in vscode or just normal terminal<br>
You can change the script anytime so its open-source i guess?<br>
### Steps:
1. Download .zip file
2. Unzip and drag the folder where you want it
3. Make sure the script is updated, copy the script from [main.py](https://github.com/simon-esp/ChainLine/blob/main/main.py)
4. Go to your terminal and type `cd chainline`
5. Run it by typing `python3 chainline.py`
6. Follow the instructions, if you are unsure about anything like your clear command just google<br>
   On windows its `cls` and on linux its `clear`
